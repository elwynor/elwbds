  Welcome to BattleDroids, mechanized arena of the future where high tech
war machines rule the battlefield, and death or glory are just a heartbeat
away. BattleDroids is played on a roughly square battlefield five thousand
'hexes' across. Each hex is approximately one hundred meters across and is
one location in the game. Any given location can contain buildings, droids
(yours or another players) or one of many cyborg piloted droids.
  Each droid is equiped with sophisticated sensor and radio gear and each
has a different array of weaponry at it's disposal. The primary weaponry
common to the droids is an energy weapon ranging in power from small lasers
weighing a quarter of a ton, to the mighty blaster auto-cannons which weigh
many tons and may only be carried by droids weighing around one hundred
tons. Some droids are also equiped with missle systems and/or mine laying
equipment. Missles come with three designations, those being SRM, MRM, and
LRM or short, medium, and long range missle respectively. All mines are
designated with the prefix LM, and both mines and missles have a number
following their two or three letter designation to specify their strength.

BDH2 {
  As well as the various types of weaponry that droids may carry, there are
several additional systems and pieces of equipment available. Among these
are items such as a repair kit, without which the damage to your droid can
not be repaired between battles. Other onboard systems available include an
extended range scanner system, and an energy screen system capable of fully
or partially deflecting fire from energy weapons. This system has no effect
on missles, landmines, or other physical damage, however.
  As you gain kills by destroying other droids either with your own droids
weapons, or simply by having your droid physically pound your adversary to
pieces, you will gain credits for the value of the wreckage left behind.
You may use these credits to purchase larger and more powerful droid chassis
or better weaponry and equipment.
  Your droid's sensors will supply you with a great deal of information if
you pay attention. They will tell you when large objects are moving nearby,
such as other droids. They will also alert you to nearby explosions, and to
weapons fire. Your droid's sensors can also detect the transporter beams
which move droids on and off the battlefield, as well as the destruction of
other droids. Your primary source of communication with others, is your
radio, which may be set to various frequencies for privacy. Your droid also
is equiped with a public address system for close range communications.

  The game can be played a number of ways, and is a lot of fun even if you
play alone because the cyborgs always keep things interesting and can be
pretty crafty. Players can form teams and have mock wars to see which side
can best the other, or you can just have a free for all for all out mayhem.
Another popular activity is cyborg hunting, but be careful not to end up
being the one who is hunted instead. There are a few other features that
can make this game a challenge and very interesting if done right, but I'll
leave those for you to discover on your own.
  For helpful information about the game and some possible commands type
'HELP' or '?' anywhere in the game. Enjoy...
